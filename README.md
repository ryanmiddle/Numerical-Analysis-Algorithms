# Numerical-Analysis-Algorithms
Algorithms written in MATLAB that utilizes numerical problem solving techniques to analyze functions and matrices. 
This repository contains numerical root finding, LU factorization, ordinary differential equation solvers, and integration algorithms all develovped during my Spring 2018 semester at Colorado State University.
